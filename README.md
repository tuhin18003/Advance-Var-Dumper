Advance Var Dumper Component
==============================

The Advance Var Dumper component provides mechanisms for walking through any arbitrary
PHP variable. It provides a better `pre_print()` function that you can use instead
of `print_r`.

It takes 2 parameters. First one is your data( array/ object/ string) and second can be any text as flag!

`pre_print( $data = '', $text = '' )`
